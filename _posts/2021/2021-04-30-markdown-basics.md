 Here are some notes about basic syntax of markdown.

# Headings

Headings are with number sign (\#) in front of a word or a phrase. The number of # signs indicate the level of the headings. For example, first-level heading is using '\#' and second level heading is using '\#\#'.
Remember to add space between "\#" and your word or phrase.

# Emphasis
In general, we need to add emphasis to the content by using bold or italic texts.

## Bold
Bold type is created by add two asterisk (\*\*) around the letter without space.
eg: **I am bold text.**

## Italic
Italic type is created by add one asterisk(\*) or underscore(\_) around the letter without space.
Eg: *I am italic text.*  or _I am italic text as well._

## Bold and Italic
This type is created by adding three asterisk (\*\*\*) around the letters without space.
Eg: ***I am both bold and italic texts.***

# Lists

## Ordered list
Ordered list is created by add numbers with a period to each line items. The following is an example.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
  1. subitem 1
  2. subitem 2

## Unordered list
Unordered list is created by add dash (\-), asterisk (\*) or plus sign (\+) in front each items.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
  - subitem 1
  - subitem 2

# Blockquotes
Blockquote is created by adding a \> in front of a sentence or paragraph.
